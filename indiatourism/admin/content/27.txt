The city of Amritsar, founded in the 1570s by Sikh Guru Ram Das, is the site of Harmandir Sahib, the holiest gurdwara (Sikh place of worship). Known in English as the Golden Temple, and surrounded by the Pool of Nectar, it's a major pilgrimage site. Also in Amritsar is Durgiana Temple, a Hindu shrine famed for its engraved silver doors.</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Governor:</b> Banwarilal Purohit Trending</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Land area:</b> 50,362 km²</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Capital: </b>Chandigarh</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Chief minister: </b>Bhagwant Mann</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Population: </b>2.8 crores (2012)</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Punjab, state of India, located in the northwestern part of the subcontinent. It is bounded by Jammu and Kashmir union territory to the north, Himachal Pradesh state to the northeast, Haryana state to the south and southeast, and Rajasthan state to the southwest and by the country of Pakistan to the west. Punjab in its present form came into existence on November 1, 1966, when most of its predominantly Hindi-speaking areas were separated to form the new state of Haryana. The city of Chandigarh, within the Chandigarh union territory, is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana.</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The word Punjab is a compound of two Persian words, panj (“five”) and āb (“water”), thus signifying the land of five waters, or five rivers (the Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej). The word’s origin can perhaps be traced to panca nada, Sanskrit for “five rivers” and the name of a region mentioned in the ancient epic the Mahabharata. As applied to the present Indian state of Punjab, however, it is a misnomer: since the partition of India in 1947, only two of those rivers, the Sutlej and the Beas, lie within Punjab’s territory, while the Ravi flows only along part of its western border. Area 19,445 square miles (50,362 square km). Pop. (2011) 27,704,236.</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Located on the north-western edge of India, Punjab is one of the prosperous states of the nation, and home to a lively, hospitable and dynamic people.</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Deriving its name from five full-bodied rivers–Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Jhelum, and Chenab–which flow through its vast plains, Punjab is representative of abundant things.</span></font></p><p><font color="#4d5156" face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Punjab is a land of ethnic and religious diversity, having borne and shaped a number of religious movements that include Sikhism, Buddhism and Sufism. The Punjabi language, too, finds its origin in the Indo-European linguistic family that includes Persian and Latin. Naturally replete with fertile soils and rich water sources, it is primarily an agricultural state, and has continually and infinitely contributed towards the food security of the Indian Republic. Punjab’s many festivals–Teej, Lohri, Basant, and Baisakhi, to name some–are celebrations that mirror the farming ethos. Indeed, Bhangra, the traditional dance of Punjab revolves around, and replicates a farmer’s daily life. Historically, Punjab has played host to a number of ethnicities, including the Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Afghans and Mongols, thus bestowed with a rich tangible heritage. Reflecting this history are the countless sites that dot the state: impressive forts &amp; palaces, ancient monuments, architectural marvels and many a battlefield.</span></font></p>
